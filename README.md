# Msg_Encryption

Got bored with life and did this....<br>
A simple way to encrypt your msg, just for fun.<br>

# Use the webApp â†’ [:robot: LINK :robot:](https://debojyoti31-simple-msg-encryption.streamlit.app/)

# Implementation

1. Turn the text into matrix.
2. To Encrypt -- Multiple the matrix with a certain key(a non-singular sqare matrix)
3. To Decrypt -- Multiple the matrix with the inverse of the key.
4. Turn the decrypted matrix into text to get the original text. 

In this implementation the shape of the key is same as the length of the longest word present in the text.<br>
For a key of shape 5, there are 10^25 possiblities. (as here I used int 1 to 10)
